When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You would want to use a remote repository in a situation where you believe that you may be moving from computer to computer.
  This is also a helpful way to do things when you are working with a team that are not in one location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might want to manually pull changes so that you can ensure that you know what changes there are, as opposed to making assumptions.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are essential the same as clones, however they are done on github at githubs servers.
	Clones take repositories from github and clone them to your local machine.
	Branches make new branches from the current branch you are on, they do not affect the master branch when you make changes.
